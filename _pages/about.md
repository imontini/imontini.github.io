Olá! I am a PhD Candidate at the Department of Political Science and a Research Associate at the Center for the Politics of Development at the University of California, Berkeley. My work spans comparative politics and political economy, with a particular focus on welfare provision by state and non-state actors and political violence. 

My dissertation project examines claim-making behavior in urban peripheries where state and criminal actors compete for authority. Specifically, I am interested in how residents of Brazilian favelas navigate fragmented governance and the strategies are used to access various goods and services. In my research, I employ a variety of methods, ranging from qualitative interviews to design-based inference and survey experiments. 

I was born and raised in São Paulo, Brazil. Prior to pursuing my PhD, I worked as a research fellow at the Poverty, Violence, and Governance Lab at Stanford University. I hold an MA in Latin American Studies with a specialization in Political Economy from Stanford University and a BA in Political Science and Sociology from Humboldt University in Berlin. I am the recipient of the 2025 Peter H. Odegard Memorial Award for outstanding performance and scholarly promise in political science at UC Berkeley. 

My research has been generously supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF), the American Political Science Association (APSA), the Development Bank of Latin America and the Caribbean (CAF), the Peace and Recovery Initiative at Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA), the Center for Effective Global Action (CEGA), the Berkeley Institute for International Studies, the Berkeley Economy and Society Initiative and the Center for Global Metropolitan Studies at UC Berkeley.

If you can't find me at my desk, I am probably playing tennis at the public courts in San Francisco's Mission District or sunbathing at Dolores Park.
