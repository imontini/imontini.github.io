Olá! I am a PhD Student at the Department of Political Science and a Research Associate at the Center for the Politics of Development at the University of California, Berkeley. My work spans comparative politics and political economy, with a particular focus on welfare provision by state and non-state actors and political violence. 

My dissertation project examines claim-making behavior in urban peripheries where state and criminal actors compete for authority. Specifically, I am interested in how residents of Brazilian favelas navigate fragmented governance and the strategies they use to access various goods and services. In my research, I employ a variety of methods, ranging from qualitative interviews and participatory methods to design-based inference and survey experiments. 

I was born and raised in São Paulo, Brazil. Prior to pursuing my PhD, I worked as a research fellow at the Poverty, Violence, and Governance Lab at Stanford University. I hold an MA in Latin American Studies with a specialization in Political Economy from Stanford University and a BA in Political Science and Sociology from Humboldt University in Berlin. 

If you can't find me at my desk, I am probably playing tennis at the public courts in San Francisco's Mission District or sunbathing at Dolores Park.
