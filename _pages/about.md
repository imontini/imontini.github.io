Olá! I am a PhD Candidate in Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley. My research sits at the intersection of comparative politics and political economy, with a focus on service provision by state and non-state actors and political violence.

My dissertation examines claim-making in urban peripheries where state and criminal actors compete for authority. I study how residents of Brazilian favelas navigate fragmented governance and the strategies they use to access goods and services. Methodologically, I draw on qualitative interviews, design-based inference, and survey experiments.

At UC Berkeley, I am a Research Associate at the Center on the Politics of Development. I am also an external fellow at Stanford University’s Poverty, Violence, and Governance Lab (PovGov). In the summer of 2025, I was a visiting scholar at Fundação Getúlio Vargas in São Paulo (FGV-CEPESP).

I am the recipient of the 2025 Peter H. Odegard Memorial Award for outstanding performance and scholarly promise in political science at UC Berkeley. My research has been supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF), the American Political Science Association (APSA), the Development Bank of Latin America and the Caribbean (CAF), the Peace and Recovery Initiative at Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA), the Center for Effective Global Action (CEGA), the Berkeley Institute for International Studies, the Berkeley Economy and Society Initiative, and the Center for Global Metropolitan Studies.

I was born and raised in São Paulo, Brazil. Before beginning my PhD, I completed an MA in Latin American Studies with a specialization in Political Economy at Stanford University and a BA in Political Science and Sociology at Humboldt University in Berlin.

If you can't find me at my desk, I am probably playing tennis at the public courts in San Francisco's Mission District or sunbathing at Dolores Park.
