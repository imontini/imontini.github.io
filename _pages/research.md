## What Do We Know about Power Sharing after 50 Years?

*With Mahmoud Farag, Hae Ran Jung, Juliette Bourdeau de Fontenay and Satveer Ladhar*

The power-sharing literature lacks a review that synthesizes its findings, despite spanning over 50 years since Arend Lijphart published his seminal 1969 article ‘Consociational Democracy’. This review article contributes to the literature by introducing and analysing an original dataset, the Power Sharing Articles Dataset, which extracts data on 23 variables from 373 academic articles published between 1969 and 2018. The power-sharing literature, our analysis shows, has witnessed a boom in publications in the last two decades, more than the average publication rate in the social sciences. This review offers a synthesis of how power sharing is theorized, operationalized, and studied. We demonstrate that power-sharing has generally positive effects, regardless of institutional set-up, post-conflict transitional character, and world region. Furthermore, we highlight structural factors that are mostly associated with the success of power sharing. Finally, the review develops a research agenda to guide future scholarly work on power sharing.

## Coercion Gaps and State-Sponsored Organized Crime Expansion: Evidence from Rio de Janeiro’s Militias

*With Bruno Pantaleão*

Mafia-type paramilitary organizations are present across many states. In Latin America, these organizations tend to be formed by former members of the military or the police and originated as vigilante groups offering some form of security services. Specifically in Brazil, these groups (milícias hereafter) have grown dramatically, becoming the main criminal actors ruling urban peripheries in the state of Rio de Janeiro. In this paper, we posit that the emergence of these groups can be explained through two main channels: institutional weakness of the provisionary arm of the state and failed public security policies. Milícias generate profit by monopolizing essential goods, extorting residents and businesses, and supplying counterfeit public goods. By empirically demonstrating their ties to local politicians and state bureaucrats—and how these relationships enable them to maintain territorial control—we argue that milícias collaborate with politicians to influence bureaucratic appointments and dictate local enforcement levels. To explain how and why the interests of mafias and politicians align within these territories, allowing for the simultaneous extraction of economic and political rents, we develop and test a theoretical model where the provision of counterfeit public goods allows them to effectively control territory, which, in turn, makes these groups attractive brokers for state actors.

## To Impeach Or Not To Impeach: Elite Polarization, Mass Mobilization, and Corruption Scandals

*With Mahmoud Farag and Philipp Schemm*

Presidential impeachment is one of the greatest manifestations of accountability. In examining the determinants of impeachment, studies have highlighted the role played by corruption scandals, mass mobilization, and the absence of a legislative shield. We contribute to this literature by underscoring the importance of elite polarization for presidential impeachment. The paper does not discredit current explanations but illustrates how elite affective and ideological polarization shapes impeachment in conjunction with the current explanations. Using a sample of successful and failed impeachments, we use fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) to examine this issue. The analysis supports our hypotheses, highlighting how elite polarization matters for impeachment (or the lack thereof). The results stand a wide range of robustness tests including sensitivity ranges, consistency thresholds, fit-oriented robustness, and cluster analysis. Given the rise of affective polarization across the globe, presidential impeachment might be increasingly weaponized by polarized elites.

## Electoral Rules and The Provision of Public versus Targeted Goods: Evidence from Mayoral Elections in Brazil 

This study examines how a single variation in electoral rules influences politicians' investment in public and targeted goods. Using a unique threshold policy introduced in Brazil in 1988, I employ a regression discontinuity design to estimate the effect of a two-round election on the distribution and quality of targeted and public goods. The results show that single-round elections are associated with greater efforts to allocate targeted goods relative to single-round elections, but I only find marginal increases in the quality of public goods delivery by mayors. Counter to previous studies, it is unclear whether two-round elections are associated with greater effort to deliver public goods. The findings suggest that previous work has focused on too narrow a set of indicators to assess the effect of this particular type of electoral rule, overlooking its impact on targeted goods provision.

## To Impeach Or Not To Impeach: Elite Polarization, Mass Mobilization, and Corruption Scandals

*With Alison E. Post*

In most low- and middle-income countries, municipalities do not collect enough tax revenue from their populations to fund the water, health, education, and transportation infrastructure their citizens require. What types of municipalities are better positioned to secure discretional funds from higher tiers of government for local infrastructure projects?  Scholarship on distributive politics emphasizes that funds typically flow to jurisdictions with core voters (controlled by aligned politicians) or those with significant numbers of swing voters. In this project, we emphasize an alternative predictor: municipality population size.  Mayors and municipal councilors in smaller municipalities have less own-source revenue available for infrastructure projects, so they have stronger incentives to lobby for funds. Such infrastructure projects are also more likely to generate political returns for local politicians and their benefactors at higher tiers of government in smaller cities because the projects are more visible, and both credit-claiming and credit-attribution efforts are, therefore, more effective.  We test this argument using an original dataset of ~ 65,000 individual budget amendments or project-specific amendments national deputies can add to Brazilian budget legislation for 2015-2023. We find an inverse relationship between municipal population size, per capita spending, and number of projects, a relationship that is particularly strong for infrastructure projects. These projects earn political returns, with budget amendment spending yielding greater increases in deputy vote shares in smaller municipalities.  Yet the quality of projects varies: deputies award simpler, cheaper projects to smaller municipalities out of concerns regarding state capacity.

## Under the Rader: Estimating Underreporting of Gender-Based Violence to the Police

*With Jessie Trudeau*

Gender-based violence (GBV) remains underreported to law enforcement, obscuring the true prevalence of violence against women and limiting institutional responses. While existing research often attributes underreporting to personal concerns, the role of broader institutional factors is less understood. Where and why are victims more likely to report gender-based violence to the police? Under what conditions can third-party reporting channels mitigate the underreporting of GBV to the police? We study gender-based violence in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, analyzing 3 million calls for help to an independent, anonymous tip line between 2008 and 2023. We geolocate and merge these calls with police records and precinct-level socioeconomic data to analyze divergent temporal and spatial reporting patterns, contrasting the frequency of gender-based violence reported to 1) the police or 2) the anonymous helpline.

Our analysis offers three main insights. First, we estimate GBV underreporting to the police. We use a novel bounding exercise that contrasts police and anonymous reporting data, which highlights the specific spatial and criminal characteristics that make types of GBV particularly vulnerable to underreporting. Second, we identify key predictors of GBV. We conduct a large-N analysis of granular predictors of violence against women over time, including socioeconomic conditions, general levels of violence, and other crimes that frequently co-occur with GBV, such as drug trafficking and corruption of minors. Third, we further identify interactive effects that exacerbate GBV. We focus on areas with high levels of police violence, violent crime, and criminal governance, shedding light on how GBV is reported in the most vulnerable areas, where state presence and governance are most contested or inadequate. We substantiate this with qualitative evidence about women in marginalized regions (like Brazil’s favelas) who often rely on social services rather than law enforcement to seek help. This paper’s contribution is twofold: first, we systematically document not only the existence of GBV reporting gaps to the police but also that these gaps are wider in marginalized communities. Then, we show the observable risk factors that could be used by policymakers to mitigate these gaps.
