### When Elections Empower Crime: Political Protection and Milícia Expansion in Rio de Janeiro  
**With Bruno Pantaleão**  
*Latin American Politics and Society* (FirstView).

  Milícias are mafia-style organizations, often composed of current and former state agents, that have rapidly expanded in areas with limited state presence and weak legal oversight. In Rio de Janeiro, their territorial control is not maintained by coercion alone, but also through strategic political alliances. This paper theorizes and tests a mechanism linking milícia expansion to electoral politics: milícias deliver concentrated electoral support to specific politicians, who in return shield their operations by influencing bureaucratic appointments and law enforcement priorities. Using original geospatial and electoral data, we show that milícia entry into a new area increases electoral concentration and disproportionately benefits milícia-aligned candidates in adjacent territories. We further demonstrate that this electoral capital is converted into political power through key bureaucratic appointments that facilitate further expansion and institutional impunity. Our findings support a theoretical framework in which elections reinforce, rather than constrain, criminal governance in democratic settings.

### What Do We Know about Power Sharing after 50 Years?

  The power-sharing literature lacks a review that synthesizes its findings, despite spanning over 50 years since Arend Lijphart published his seminal 1969 article “Consociational Democracy”. This review article contributes to the literature by introducing and analysing an original dataset, the Power Sharing Articles Dataset, which extracts data on 23 variables from 373 academic articles published between 1969 and 2018. The power-sharing literature, our analysis shows, has witnessed a boom in publications in the last two decades, more than the average publication rate in the social sciences. This review offers a synthesis of how power sharing is theorized, operationalized, and studied. We demonstrate that power-sharing has generally positive effects, regardless of institutional set-up, post-conflict transitional character, and world region. Furthermore, we highlight structural factors that are mostly associated with the success of power sharing. Finally, the review develops a research agenda to guide future scholarly work on power-sharing.

## Working Papers

### Size Matters: Pork Politics and State Presence in Brazilian Municipalities  
**With Alison E. Post**

  State presence is often considered weakest in a country’s periphery. In contrast, we argue that small towns on the periphery have more influence on the distribution of centrally-allocated public works than is commonly understood. Infrastructure projects yield greater political returns in smaller municipalities because they are more visible, less costly, and credit-attribution is simpler. Combining extensive fieldwork with a novel dataset of over 60,000 project-specific amendments added to the Brazilian budget by national deputies (2015–2023), we show that smaller municipalities receive more projects and funds per capita than larger ones. Deputies also gain greater vote returns per Real spent in smaller towns. Yet this higher spending often takes the form of simpler, lower-quality projects, allowing critical infrastructure gaps in water, health, education, and transportation to persist. Thus, while more infrastructure flows to the periphery, it is of lower quality, reinforcing the paradox of visible state presence but limited state capacity.

### Under the Radar: Estimating Underreporting of Gender-Based Violence to the Police

  <p>
  Gender-based violence (GBV) is chronically underreported to law enforcement. Existing research emphasizes individual-level factors, but overlooks how broader police behavior shapes reporting. We argue that police violence has a dual effect by (1) discouraging reporting GBV to the police, while (2) shifting reporting towards third-party channels, when available. We link police records with anonymous call logs to an independent hotline to estimate the relationship between police violence and GBV reporting in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Our analyses demonstrate that exposure to police violence is associated with a relative decline in reporting to the police vis-a-vis the hotline. We then estimate the causal effect of an exogenous decrease in access to the anonymous hotline. GBV reports to the hotline fell by 45%, but fewer than half of these estimated callers filed a police report instead. The areas where women were least likely to call the polic
